# Dynaphopy Guide and Silicon Calculation Example

This repository contains resources for using **Dynaphopy**, a software for the calculation of phonon properties using molecular dynamics simulations.

## Contents

### 1. Dynaphopy Guide
Refer to the [DynaPhoPy Guide](DynaPhoPy.pdf) for detailed instructions on how to install and run DynaPhoPy together with PhonoPy. 

### 2. Silicon Calculation Example
The [Silicon Calculation](Si-LAMMPS/) directory contains input files and instructions for running a phonon calculation for silicon
