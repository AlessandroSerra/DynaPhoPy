# Dynaphopy Guide and Silicon Calculation Example

This repository contains resources for using **Dynaphopy**, a software for the calculation of phonon properties using molecular dynamics simulations.

## Contents

- **`dynaphopy_guide.pdf`**: A comprehensive guide to using Dynaphopy, covering installation, basic usage, and advanced features.
- **`silicon_example/`**: A folder containing an example of a phonon calculation for silicon. The example demonstrates how to use Dynaphopy to compute phonon properties based on molecular dynamics simulations.

## How to Use

### 1. Dynaphopy Guide
Refer to the [DynaPhoPy Guide](DynaPhoPy.pdf) for detailed instructions on how to install and run DynaPhoPy together with PhonoPy. 

### 2. Silicon Calculation Example
The [Silicon Calculation](Si-LAMMPS/) directory contains input files and instructions for running a phonon calculation for silicon
